!Suppose we want to look at mixing length for low mass stars. Lets say we are interested in the difference of the ZAMS due to mixing length and overshoot mixing length.

&basics
! We don't need to calculate the inlist, because we the grid with 'standard' mixing length will be part of run1
	output_dir = "mixing_length_influence_low_mass"
	calculate_grid = False

/



&grid
	!We want to calculate the evolution for ten masses between 0.5 and 1 solar mass
    initial_mass = "linspace,0.5,1,10"
/ 


&run1
	!In the first run, we change the mixing length between 0.5 and 3 in unequal steps
    mixing_length_alpha = "float,0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,1.4,1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5"
/ 

&run2
	!In the second run, we change the mixing length in overshooting regions to see if there is a different influence. But we don't need so much different values
	overshoot_alpha = "float,1,1.5,2"
